# Delivery Route Optimization Project

## Overview

This project is focused on optimizing delivery routes for a truck using algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The goal is to determine the best route and optimal start time that minimizes travel time while considering variable traffic conditions (rush hours and off-peak times). The project evaluates the performance of these algorithms against an optimal solution using PuLP.

## Project Files

### 1. Project - Deliverable 2.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook is the core of the project and includes:

- **Introduction**: Background and context of the delivery route problem
- **Problem Statement**: Details of the delivery route optimization challenge
- **Decision Variables and Constraints**: Definition of key variables and constraints used in the algorithms
- **Code Implementation**: Complete code for building graphs, executing GA and ACO, and analyzing travel times
- **Notes and Explanations**: Supporting commentary to help understand the logic and methods used in the implementation

### 2. Quality Check.ipynb

This notebook contains:

- **Algorithm Performance Evaluation**: Code that compares the minimum travel time achieved by GA and ACO with the optimal solution generated by PuLP
- **Node-Based Analysis**: Evaluation based on the number of cities (nodes) to observe how the algorithms scale with problem size

### 3. Quality Check.docx

- **Graphs and Visual Analysis**: Contains visual representations of the data showing the performance of GA and ACO against PuLP for different city configurations

### 4. Comparison-Cities.xlsx

- **Data Compilation**: Includes minimum travel time, number of cities, and optimal start hour (highlighted in yellow) for both GA and ACO
- **Charts for Comparison**: Visual charts to facilitate a quick understanding of how GA and ACO perform against PuLP for different scenariosRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
